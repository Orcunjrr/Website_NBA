                        <p>
                            The San Antonio Spurs are an American professional basketball team that represents the city of San Antonio, Texas, in the NBA.
                             The team plays its home games at Frost Bank Center in San Antonio. It plays in the Southwest Group of the Western Conference in the NBA. 
                             The franchise has won NBA championships in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team started out as the Dallas Chaparrals in the American Basketball Association (ABA). The Chaparrals were moderately successful, 
                            but the team was sold to a group of San Antonio businessmen in 1973, relocated, and renamed the Spurs. George (“the Iceman”) Gervin—a future Hall of Famer who
                             joined the franchise midway through the 1973–74 season—was the star of the early San Antonio teams, a high-scoring shooting guard who would help establish the Spurs
                              as a consistent contender throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

                    <p>
                        This is where it all began.
                        The Spurs have long been a model franchise for a number of different reasons. They have one of the greatest coaches of all-time in Greg Popovich.
                        Their front office is one of the most well-respected in the league at finding diamonds in the rough like Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard. But no other moment was so 
                        consequential to their franchise and all of its future success than drafting Timothy Theodore Duncan first overall.

                    <h2>The Dynasty</h2>
                    <p>
                        The word "dynasty" has often been used to describe the run San Antonio had from 1999 until 2014, in which it won five NBA championships in 15 seasons to go along 
                        with three Western Conference Finals appearances and another NBA Finals showing. Some have even taken it a step further to include their spot in the 2017 Western Conference Finals.

                    <h2>Spurs Win First Trophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The San Antonio Spurs were led by their iconic big man duo. David Robinson long buoyed the Spurs to moderate success in the 90s, right until Tim Duncan arrived t carry them to the promised land.
                        Young Timmy averaged 27.4 points and 14 rebounds during the series, but it was diminutive point guard Avery Johnson who stuck the dagger in the Knicks' heart in '99.

                    <p>
                        Spurs have a tradition of effective offensive play. Quarterbacks such as Tony Parker and later Dejounte Murray were successful in organizing offenses.
                        Their success, especially in outside shots, enabled them to control their game. Ball sharing and passing traffic as a team is one of the keys to Spurs'
                        offensive performance. Their system aims to create open space and find the best shot.
                        Spurs have a tradition of defending as a team. Emphasizes systems, rotations, and cooperation. They have an effective collective defense approach to create difficult shots against their opponents.
                        Aside from players like Victor Wembanyama, rim defense is one of the Spurs' strengths. They position well, block and are effective in defensive rebounds.
