                        <p>
                            The Cleveland Cavaliers, or more commonly known as the Cavs, are a team from Cleveland, Ohio, in the Central Division of the NBA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, 
                            followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the
                             Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the 
                            Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3â€“1.

                        That night, the ping pong balls bounced in the right direction and Cavaliers fans celebrated as if they had just won an NBA championship. James helped the Cavaliers return to 
                        winning ways, making the playoffs in five of the next seven years and the king later gifted them with a title.

                    <h2>Four Consecutive NBA Finals Appearances</h2>
                    <p>
                        Muscled by a big three of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love with the help of a deep bench and good coaching, the Cleveland Cavaliers dominated the Eastern Conference. 
                        The Cavaliers and Warriors matched up so many times that they set a NBA record for most consecutive Finals matchups. Although, not many fans outside of Cleveland or the Bay Area
                        were enthusiastic about that fact.

                        What a way to end off one of the greatest seasons in NBA history, highlighted by the farewell tour of Kobe Bryant, the 73-9 Warriors team,
                        the incredibly competitive layout of the NBA, and it was all capped off with the greatest playoff series the NBA has ever seen. The Warriors
                        jumped out to an early 3-1 lead in the first four games, but this would not deter the greatest of all-time and his squad of elite players.

                        On the offensive side, the Cleveland Cavaliers are a team that draws attention primarily with outside shooting and fast break. Especially in their offensive organizations,
                         they use important strategies to make effective shots from behind the three-point line. However, sometimes this style of play may not translate into a stable offensive performance 
                         and they may experience periodic ups and downs. Cleveland Cavaliers may experience difficulties on the defensive side from time to time. From time to time, they can be vulnerable 
                         in fast attack defense and score easy points from their opponents' fast attacks. However, despite this, they can increase the defensive resistance by capturing important moments 
                         in the team's defense from time to time.
